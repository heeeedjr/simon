# simon
This is my implementation of the Simon game. This is for my CS260 class. My code is simply a rework of provided code to allow for experimentation.

SVG: 
M move <to x,y> 
Q quadratic curve <control point x,y> <to x,y>

CSS:
- I really need to work on understanding how Flex works. It is super powerful, but hard to understand without lots of playing around. I feel like I never get it perfect.
- Also CSS frameworks are SUPER powerful. It really can bring a webpage to life.
- The last thing I want to ask myself is when to use pixels, rems, ems, or percents for spacing. Even in the class example they are used at different places and I really don't know the perfect time to use them.
